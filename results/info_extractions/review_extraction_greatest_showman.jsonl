\nHouse of Lies — But It’s Entertaining as Hell! \n2016’s The Founder took a pretty incisive and honest look at the American Dream. It wasn’t afraid to \npeer at the shitty underbelly of success and note that it often owes as much to hard work and \ninnovation as it does to back-stabbing and moral compromise. Hugh Jackman’s The Greatest \nShowman also takes a look at the American Dream — but it comes to a very different conclusion, \nwhich is that the American Dream is a wonderful, joyous thing! \nThe Greatest Showman re-imagines the life of consummate huckster P.T. Barnum as a sparkling feel-\ngood pop musical that celebrates a quintessential American success story: the rise of a rags-to-riches \nvisionary who makes it to the top through the power of dreaming big and never giving up. Along the \nway he helps a band of outcasts feel like they belong and have a place in this world. Wrapped in a \nbubble gum sheathe of razzle-dazzle, catchy songs and elaborately choreographed dance sequences, \nthe movie is a testament to the empty spectacle of American showbusiness’s love affair with itself. \nThe film goes straight to the Disney/Dickens template of the poor orphan boy with big dreams who is \nchallenged by a disapproving society and arrogant elites, only to overcome these trials with a rag-tag \nband of misfits and become the greatest showman of them all. The film’s smash hit anthem, “This is \nMe”, is a full-throated declaration that it’s OK to be different (like if you are a woman and have a beard) \nand celebrates the bravery of embracing your quirks even in the face of a society that doesn’t accept \nyou. It’s a fine uplifting message and the song is catchy as hell. But I have one small problem with it, \nalong with the rest of the themes buoying this film. It’s all based on dastardly lies! \nThe real P.T. Barnum was not a Nicholas Nickleby stand-in for the aspirations of big dreamers in the \nlower and middle classes. He was a huckster, an exploitative charlatan and a snake-oil salesman. His \ntrue visionary genius was in realizing that there was an enormous market of gullible Americans out \nthere waiting to be dazzled by the bizarre and the macabre and taken in by elaborate and shocking \nhoaxes. Famously, one of his first claims to fame was when he sewed the head and torso of a monkey \nto the tail of a fish and called it a mermaid. This anecdote was conveniently omitted from the film for \nsome reason. It also glossed over the fact that Barnum began his career by purchasing a blind, \nparalyzed slave woman and then put her on exhibition and claimed she was the 161-year-old nurse of \nGeorge Washington. \nNow, I am not really a fan of retroactively judging people who lived centuries ago by the moral \nstandards of our time. But even a cursory look at Barnum’s real biography makes it painfully obvious \nthat his success came from a willingness to exploit and defraud people. His shows were not \ncelebrations of unique identity in a conformist world. They were a chance for him to extract money\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nfrom hulking idiots in exchange for letting them gawk at people suffering from gigantism and other \nmaladies. When a regular case of dwarfism was deemed not thrilling or obscene enough, he had no \ncompunctions about defrauding his audience with trickery (this is hinted at in the film, but is played \noff as an endearingly rueful character trait). \nThe man was a straight-up fraudster. And he parlayed this talent into one of the great American myths \nof our time — the archetype of the consummate showman, the visionary genius who uses his \nmarketing acumen and his showmanship and his charisma and his drive and his dreams to create \nbrand new markets out of whole cloth that didn’t exist before. And this myth is fine, as far as it goes — \nbut it leaves out a crucial element which is that along with all that, the consummate showman is \nexploiting people at every turn. In Barnum’s case he exploited the buttoned-down 19th century social \ndesire to be scandalized and titillated, he exploited the gullibility of the public, and he exploited the \npeople working for him by putting them on display so that people could ogle what were often serious \nmedical conditions in exchange for money. \nThe film steers clear of any of these issues, and instead just aims to dazzle us with spectacle. And I \nhave to say — the spectacle is a hell of a lot of fun! At its heart this is a damn entertaining, fun piece of \ntheater and though it totally re-imagines Barnum, avoiding the controversy and the interesting bits in \norder to give us a paint-by-numbers protagonist we can cheer for, it does succeed as a slick musical. \nI prefer musicals in the style of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelley, where the camera would just roll and \nshoot long takes intended to capture the magic of those guys when they moved. But you can’t expect \nthat in a modern musical, I suppose, and all the hyper-kinetic quick cuts (probably to obscure the real \ndancing ability of the stars) were in line with the overall spastic energy and momentum of the film. The \nsoundtrack is diabolically good, and the choreography excellent. There is even a cameo as a \nmustached bartender from Daniel “Cloud” Campos, probably the best dancer in the world, who \nhelped Jackman train for the part. The period setting is superb (and I am a sucker for a good period \npiece). \nThe Greatest Showman is thus loads of fun. It’s energetic, it’s uplifting, it has great music and great \nsequences. It is also hagiographic revisionism, to be sure, that avoids engaging with the reality of \nBarnum’s life in any meaningful way. I felt this was a missed opportunity, especially since we are \ncurrently living in an age where a huckster embodying many of the same traits that made Barnum \nlegendary has defrauded his way into the White House by selling the American people the same kind \nof bunkum that Barnum peddled. It’s amazing how little some fundamental aspects of American \nsociety have changed over the centuries, how we are still susceptible to manipulative hustlers as long \nas they conceal their true intent under a veneer of compelling showmanship. We love to swallow that \nbullshit as long as it’s shiny enough, and indeed even I found myself willing to more or less ignore the \nfilm’s distortions of the truth because it entertained the hell out of me for two hours. This peculiar\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nweakness of the American mind to ignore uncomfortable truths as long as we are being dazzled and \nentertained and stupefied — THAT would have been a really interesting road for the film to explore. \nBut alas, it did not and in the end we just have to content ourselves with hearing “This is Me” played on \nthe radio every twenty fucking minutes for the rest of our lives.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_9cb9bb9a"}
