Movie Review: The Greatest Showman is Built on a 
House of Lies — But It’s Entertaining as Hell! 
2016’s The Founder took <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a pretty incisive and honest look</span> at the American Dream. It wasn’t afraid to 
peer at the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">shitty underbelly of success</span> and note that it often owes as much to hard work and 
innovation as it does to back-stabbing and moral compromise. Hugh Jackman’s The Greatest 
Showman also takes a look at the American Dream — but it comes to a very different conclusion, 
which is that the American Dream is a wonderful, joyous thing! 
The Greatest Showman re-imagines the life of consummate huckster P.T. Barnum as a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">sparkling feel-
good pop musical</span> that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">celebrates a quintessential American success story</span>: the rise of a rags-to-riches 
visionary who makes it to the top through the power of dreaming big and never giving up. Along the 
way he helps a band of outcasts feel like they belong and have a place in this world. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Wrapped in a 
bubble gum sheathe of razzle-dazzle, catchy songs and elaborately choreographed dance sequences</span>, 
the movie is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a testament to the empty spectacle of American showbusiness’s love affair with itself</span>. 
The film goes straight to the Disney/Dickens template of the poor orphan boy with big dreams who is 
challenged by a disapproving society and arrogant elites, only to overcome these trials with a rag-tag 
band of misfits and become the greatest showman of them all. The film’s smash hit anthem, “This is 
Me”, is a full-throated declaration that it’s OK to be different (like if you are a woman and have a beard) 
and celebrates the bravery of embracing your quirks even in the face of a society that doesn’t accept 
you. It’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a fine uplifting message</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the song is catchy as hell</span>. But I have one small problem with it, 
along with the rest of the themes buoying this film. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s all based on dastardly lies!</span> 
The real P.T. Barnum was not a Nicholas Nickleby stand-in for the aspirations of big dreamers in the 
lower and middle classes. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He was a huckster, an exploitative charlatan and a snake-oil salesman.</span> His 
true visionary genius was in realizing that there was an enormous market of gullible Americans out 
there waiting to be dazzled by the bizarre and the macabre and taken in by elaborate and shocking 
hoaxes. Famously, one of his first claims to fame was when he sewed the head and torso of a monkey 
to the tail of a fish and called it a mermaid. This anecdote was conveniently omitted from the film for 
some reason. It also glossed over the fact that Barnum began his career by purchasing a blind, 
paralyzed slave woman and then put her on exhibition and claimed she was the 161-year-old nurse of 
George Washington. 
Now, I am not really a fan of retroactively judging people who lived centuries ago by the moral 
standards of our time. But even a cursory look at Barnum’s real biography makes it painfully obvious 
that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">his success came from a willingness to exploit and defraud people.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">His shows were not 
celebrations of unique identity in a conformist world.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">They were a chance for him to extract money</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
from hulking idiots in exchange for letting them gawk at people suffering from gigantism and other 
maladies. When a regular case of dwarfism was deemed not thrilling or obscene enough, he had no 
compunctions about defrauding his audience with trickery (this is hinted at in the film, but is played 
off as an endearingly rueful character trait). 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The man was a straight-up fraudster.</span> And he parlayed this talent into one of the great American myths 
of our time — the archetype of the consummate showman, the visionary genius who uses his 
marketing acumen and his showmanship and his charisma and his drive and his dreams to create 
brand new markets out of whole cloth that didn’t exist before. And this myth is fine, as far as it goes — 
but it leaves out a crucial element which is that along with all that, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the consummate showman is 
exploiting people at every turn.</span> In Barnum’s case he exploited the buttoned-down 19th century social 
desire to be scandalized and titillated, he exploited the gullibility of the public, and he exploited the 
people working for him by putting them on display so that people could ogle what were often serious 
medical conditions in exchange for money. 
The film steers clear of any of these issues, and instead just <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">aims to dazzle us with spectacle</span>. And I 
have to say — <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the spectacle is a hell of a lot of fun</span>! At its heart this is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a damn entertaining, fun piece of 
theater</span> and though it totally re-imagines Barnum, avoiding the controversy and the interesting bits in 
order to give us a paint-by-numbers protagonist we can cheer for, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it does succeed as a slick musical</span>. 
I prefer musicals in the style of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelley, where the camera would just roll and 
shoot long takes intended to capture the magic of those guys when they moved. But you can’t expect 
that in a modern musical, I suppose, and all <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the hyper-kinetic quick cuts (probably to obscure the real 
dancing ability of the stars) were in line with the overall spastic energy and momentum of the film</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The 
soundtrack is diabolically good</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the choreography excellent</span>. There is even a cameo as a 
mustached bartender from Daniel “Cloud” Campos, probably the best dancer in the world, who 
helped Jackman train for the part. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The period setting is superb</span> (and I am a sucker for a good period 
piece). 
The Greatest Showman is thus <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">loads of fun</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s energetic, it’s uplifting, it has great music and great 
sequences</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It is also hagiographic revisionism, to be sure, that avoids engaging with the reality of 
Barnum’s life in any meaningful way</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I felt this was a missed opportunity</span>, especially since we are 
currently living in an age where a huckster embodying many of the same traits that made Barnum 
legendary has defrauded his way into the White House by selling the American people the same kind 
of bunkum that Barnum peddled. It’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">amazing how little some fundamental aspects of American 
society have changed over the centuries</span>, how <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">we are still susceptible to manipulative hustlers</span> as long 
as they conceal their true intent under a veneer of compelling showmanship. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">We love to swallow that 
bullshit as long as it’s shiny enough</span>, and indeed even <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I found myself willing to more or less ignore the 
film’s distortions of the truth because it entertained the hell out of me for two hours</span>. This <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">peculiar</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 3**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
weakness of the American mind to ignore uncomfortable truths as long as we are being dazzled and 
entertained and stupefied — <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">THAT would have been a really interesting road for the film to explore</span>. 
But <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">alas, it did not</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">in the end we just have to content ourselves with hearing “This is Me” played on 
the radio every twenty fucking minutes for the rest of our lives</span>.
