(Choose all that apply)\". The options are: \"Consist of numerical values\" (97% correct), \"Often organized in a tabular format\" (92% correct), \"May contain unstructured text data\" (8% correct), and \"Primarily used for statistical analysis and machine learning models\" (92% correct). Below this, it states \"Attempts: 50 out of 50.\""

What is a characteristic about uh uh about data matrix dataset? First, you need to know they are consist of numerical value. Often organized in a tabular format. And they don't have unstructured data. They don't. They will not have unstructured data. And they can utilize a lot of statistic method and machine learning way to working with that. If you took machine learning course, usually they assume the data already been convert into data matrix. They usually consider about that. So a lot of machine learning are starting from matrix operation. So then because of it, your data need to go through the preprocessing to convert them to corresponding data matrix. They are not structured data. They can contain the paragraphs, sentences and words. In order for you to convert them to a matrix site, but then originally they are paragraph and the sentence and words. And then they might need some natural language processing NLP technique for you to convert them. And like after 2013, we have large language model, we can utilize that way to convert to it. And then we usually before 2013, people try to talking about them is called information retrieval. So you need some text analysis try to working with that. And that is difference between the document and data and data matrix data.",

So for example, you went to 7-11, you purchase certain item. And those item will be keep in one transaction. And why we call them transaction is because how the item appear in the transaction. We don't care about the order. So the bread, Coke, Milk, if you do Milk, Coke, Coke and Bread, they are the same. So then we don't care about order in transaction. So for example, the world wide web, they are graph data. So the graph data means certain graph analysis. Uh, if you don't really have time to talking about how to analyze the graph, if you interested in there, you actually can took some courses, like the graph network, thing like that, and then we're talking so much about how to working with that. And then we also have the something we call them ordered data. The data have the order.",
